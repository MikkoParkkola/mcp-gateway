# MRTR.7 — wiring `InputBridge::run` into the production path

Status: design, not implemented. Reviewed by: GPT-5.x and Kimi K2, both
SHIP-WITH-FIXES, both naming the same blocker. Findings disposed below.
Change: `fix/mrtr2-continuation-handle`, HEAD `33f64798`.

## Problem

`src/gateway/input_bridge.rs` implements `InputBridge::run` and 21 acceptance
rows drive it green through trait fakes. It has **no production call site**, so
`docs/requirements/RELEASE-4.0.0-criteria-status.md:130,:131` are honestly
marked UNWIRED. Tests-only reachability is a D7:WIRED failure, not done.

## Scope

FOR: giving `InputBridge::run` one production caller **on the HTTP transports**,
so a legacy client that declared a capability at `initialize` is asked the
backend's question and the backend is retried with the answer.

OUT: legacy **stdio** callers, which keep the MRTR.9 refusal they get today —
ruled by the requester on 2026-09-05, on the finding below that stdio's serial
read loop deadlocks any bridged call. The stdio concurrency work is its own
change, not a step inside this one. Also out: the row-308 SSE delivery half (its
own deferral, trigger is this commit); the `NFR.OBS.4` counter name
(`RELEASE-4.0.0-cluster-a-readiness.md:44` — "No design, no counters"); any
change to the MRTR.9 refusal or to the continuation mint for modern callers; the
two defects the review raised inside `input_bridge.rs` itself (unvalidated
params, request-kind-blind reply projection), which are that file's bugs and not
this change's wiring.

Consequence, stated rather than discovered later: rows :130 and :131 go green
for the HTTP transports only. Whether that reads as met, or as met with a named
limit, is the release owner's call and not this design's.

## Where it goes

`src/gateway/meta_mcp/invoke.rs`, between the MRTR.9 undeclared gate (:1517)
and the continuation mint (:1543).

After the gate, not before: a question the client never declared is refused,
never bridged. Bridging first would relay the request the gate exists to stop.

Before the mint, and instead of it for a bridged call: a legacy client never
redeems a continuation. Minting one for an exchange the gateway is about to
complete itself leaves a redeemable envelope for a finished exchange — the
MRTR.2 replay surface, pointed at our own state.

On success `run` returns the backend's completed result, which replaces
`result` and flows through the response-contract gate below unchanged. On
`BridgeError` the call fails; the error's variants already distinguish a
person's refusal from a transport fault, which is what `NFR.OBS.4` needs.

## Blocker — the capability store this presupposes does not exist

`CallerContext::input_capabilities` is populated only from
`RequestShape::declared_capabilities()` (`src/protocol/meta.rs:406-408`), which
reads the **per-request** `_meta` of a `Modern` request. `RequestShape::Legacy`
yields `Declared::NONE` (asserted at `src/protocol/meta.rs:549`). The only
production write is `src/gateway/router/handlers.rs:705,1164`; the other three
construction sites pass `Declared::NONE` outright.

Two consequences, both fatal to the feature as specified:

1. A **legacy** client sends no `_meta` by definition, so it declares nothing,
   so `InputBridge::plan` asks it nothing. The bridge can never fire for the
   only client class it exists for.
2. Rows 311 and 325 assert the **session** store is authoritative and the
   per-request slice may only narrow it. There is no session store. `run`
   already takes `declared` and `slice` as separate arguments and pins that
   rule; production has one value, and it is the slice.

Verified on the write side rather than inferred from the read side: a search
for `declared_capabilities` across `src/` returns one producer.

MCP's `initialize` handshake is where a legacy client declares `elicitation`,
`sampling` and `roots`. The gateway does not retain it — a search for
`"capabilities"` across the router and server finds one test assertion and no
store.

## Options for the missing store

**A. Capture `initialize` client capabilities per session; pass as `declared`.**
The store the requirements already assume. `run`'s two arguments become two
real values: session store authoritative, per-request slice narrowing.
Pro: rows 311 and 325 become true statements about production, not about fakes.
Con: a new per-session store with its own lifetime and eviction; largest change.

**B. Derive "legacy" from `RequestShape::Legacy` and treat any legacy caller as
declaring everything.** Smallest diff.
Pro: unblocks the bridge today.
Con: fail-open. It asks a client for a capability it never claimed, which is
the exact inversion of the MRTR.9 gate one branch above. Rejected.

**C. Option A's store, plus `shape: RequestShape` on `CallerContext`, bridging
only for `Legacy`.** A modern caller that declared capabilities must get a
continuation, not a bridge, and `Declared` alone cannot tell the two apart.

Recommendation: **C**. Deriving the discriminator from `Declared` conflates
"declared nothing" with "cannot understand `input_required`", and those two
need opposite handling.

## Second blocker — stdio cannot answer a question it is being asked

Both reviewers returned SHIP-WITH-FIXES. One finding is fatal to the feature on
the transport it exists for, and it is verified at source rather than accepted
on the reviewer's word.

`src/gateway/server/mod.rs:1581` is `while let Ok(Some(line)) =
reader.next_line().await { … dispatch … }` — one reader, strictly serial, the
next line read only after the current dispatch returns. A bridged call blocks
inside that dispatch waiting for the client's answer, and the answer arrives on
the stdin nobody is reading. Every legacy stdio bridge deadlocks until
`BridgeBounds::DEFAULT` expires it: 30 s per prompt, 120 s aggregate.

This is not a defect in the bridge. It is the transport lacking the concurrency
the bridge presupposes, and no placement of the call inside `invoke.rs` avoids
it. Two honest responses, and the choice was not engineering's to make alone:

- **Make stdio concurrent** — dispatch off the read loop, route replies by id
  before dispatch, one serialized writer, an `initialize` barrier. A transport
  rewrite, several times the size of the wiring this design is for.
- **Bridge only where the concurrency already exists** — the HTTP transports
  have in-flight request correlation (`ProxyManager`'s pending-response path).
  Legacy stdio callers keep the MRTR.9 refusal they get today.

Asked of the requester, 2026-09-05. Answer: bridge on HTTP only; stdio
concurrency becomes its own change. It narrowed this design's FOR to the HTTP
transports and moved stdio to OUT, above.

## Review findings, disposed

| finding | disposal |
|---|---|
| gate refuses before the bridge is reached (both vendors, HIGH) | confirmed as a **documentation** gap, not a mechanism one — see below |
| read side never verified: does the bridge site hold the session id (Kimi, HIGH) | **died at source.** The lookup belongs at `CallerContext` construction, where `session_id` is already in scope on both transports. Nothing new reaches `invoke.rs`, and the suggested fix — threading a store into the invoke path — is unnecessary |
| absent session capabilities leave the default unspecified (Kimi, HIGH) | confirmed. Pinned fail-closed below |
| store has no eviction or ownership (both vendors, HIGH) | confirmed. Bound to session lifecycle below |
| no production `ClientChannel` / `BackendInvoker` / `BridgeObserver` (GPT, HIGH, CERTAIN) | confirmed. This design understated its own change surface; see below |
| stdio serial dispatch deadlocks a bridged call (GPT, HIGH, CERTAIN) | confirmed at source. Second blocker, above |
| reply projection is not request-kind-aware; params forwarded unvalidated (GPT) | out of this scope — defects in `input_bridge.rs` itself, not in wiring it. Filed rather than fixed here |
| store as an injected trait (Kimi) | declined. A trait with one implementation is an abstraction nothing asked for. `BridgeObserver` earns its trait because production genuinely passes a no-op; a capability store does not |

### One capability value, two consumers

The gate at `invoke.rs:1514` reads `caller.input_capabilities`. So does the
bridge. Feeding that one field from the merged value — session store
authoritative, per-request slice narrowing — makes the gate consult the merged
set by construction, with no second consumer to keep in step. Stating it is the
fix; changing the gate would be the defect.

The merge happens where `CallerContext` is built, not where it is read:
`src/gateway/router/handlers.rs:705,1164` (HTTP, `session_id` in scope at :707)
and `src/gateway/server/mod.rs:1827` (stdio, `session_id` in scope from :1722,
constant `"stdio-session"` at :1579).

**Absent is fail-closed.** No captured capabilities for a session — evicted,
pre-store, restarted — means the client declared nothing, and the question is
refused. The rejected option B is exactly what a fail-open default would
reintroduce through the back door.

**The store is not a store.** Declarations are co-owned by each transport's
existing session state and cleared or replaced atomically on `initialize`,
disconnect, session `DELETE` and reap. A session id is client-supplied and
reusable; a declaration that outlives its session is inherited permission.

### Change surface, stated

Wiring one call is the smallest part of this.

- `Declared::parse` (`src/protocol/meta.rs:367`) already takes a plain
  capabilities map of exactly the `initialize` shape, and already reads the 2026
  elicitation modes from it — an empty `elicitation` object declares form mode.
  It is **private**. Making it reachable widens visibility, which is a design
  decision rather than a convenience edit.
- a write in `MetaMcp::handle_initialize`, a read at each of the five
  `CallerContext` construction sites (`handlers.rs:705,1164`,
  `invoke.rs:3816,3846,3881`, `server/mod.rs:1827,2619`).
- `shape` threaded to each of those sites, and production implementations of
  the bridge's three traits, which today exist only as test fakes.
- `CallerContext::input_capabilities` currently documents itself as "what this
  caller declared on **this** request". That contract changes to the merged
  value; the comment changes with it.

### Decision table

| shape | declared | outcome |
|---|---|---|
| modern | yes | continuation minted, as today |
| modern | no | refused by MRTR.9, as today |
| legacy | yes (from `initialize`) | bridged |
| legacy | no | refused by MRTR.9, as today |

## Unknowns, scheduled

1. Does the gateway see `initialize` on every transport that can be bridged
   (stdio, SSE, streamable HTTP), or only some? — read the two production
   dispatch sites — RESOLVED: both reach one shared handler,
   `MetaMcp::handle_initialize` (`src/gateway/meta_mcp/mod.rs:1151`), from
   `src/gateway/server/mod.rs:1788` (stdio serve loop) and
   `src/gateway/router/handlers.rs:926` (HTTP router). It already receives both
   values a per-session store needs: the `initialize` `params`, which carry the
   client's `capabilities` object, and a `session_id` that both call sites pass
   as `Some(..)`, never `None`. Changed the design: option A's store goes
   inside that handler, one write site covering every bridgeable transport, not
   one per transport as the option feared.
2. Is the `NFR.OBS.4` counter name decided anywhere? — deferred. Owner: the
   readiness doc's owner. Resolves when a counter design exists. Nothing here
   depends on it: `BridgeObserver` is a trait, and production can pass a no-op
   until the name is chosen, which is honest rather than inventing a literal.

3. Which existing session state should carry the declarations, on each
   transport? — read the session lifecycle the HTTP router already maintains
   (`rg -n "session" src/gateway/router/session*.rs src/gateway/router/mod.rs`)
   and name the owner before writing one. Blocking: nothing may be implemented
   against a store whose lifetime owner is unnamed, because that is how the
   eviction finding comes back.

## What is not claimed

The 21 bridge rows are reported green by a peer session (21 passed, 0 failed,
0.50s). This session has not reproduced that run, so the evidence level is I —
one run, reported — not V.

The obstacle was disk, and it is fixed: the root filesystem stood at 4.4 GB
free (99% used), below the fail-fast threshold that halts the build. Cleaning
this worktree's `target/` returned 6.9 GB, leaving 10.9 GB. The test command
itself remains refused until 13:41 UTC by a circumvention latch recorded
against the earlier disk block, which expires on a four-hour timer. Re-running
both acceptance suites after that expiry is what raises this to V; nothing in
this design should be implemented on the strength of the reported run alone.
