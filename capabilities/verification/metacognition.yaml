# Metacognition NLI Verification - Gateway Capability
#
# This capability exposes metacognition verification via the MCP Gateway
# for on-demand semantic verification. Use this for occasional verification
# when the full MCP server overhead isn't justified.
#
# For high-frequency verification (every Write/Edit), use direct MCP instead.

  Semantic NLI verification for LLM outputs. Detects contradictions and
  hallucinations with 91.5% accuracy using DeBERTa NLI model.

  Use when: Verifying important outputs before accepting them.
  Returns: {passed: bool, confidence: float, failures: [...]}
