//! Per-agent identity verification (OWASP ASI03 — Identity and Privilege Abuse).
//!
//! Closes the gap where any valid session token grants the same access regardless
//! of which agent is calling.  This module provides identity *plumbing*: extraction,
//! optional enforcement, and structured audit logging.  Full IAM is out of scope.
//!
//! # Proof outranks assertion
//!
//! Three inputs, two kinds. The **proven** principal is whichever of these the
//! request established, ranked by [`ProofSource`]'s `Ord` and not by the order
//! anything is checked in:
//!
//! 1. mTLS client-certificate subject — first SAN URI, else CN, else no mTLS
//!    principal at all.
//! 2. Verified JWT `sub`, taken from a token the agent-auth middleware already
//!    validated against registered key material.
//!
//! The **declared** label is the `X-Agent-ID` header, else the `agent_id` query
//! parameter. It is telemetry and cost attribution only. It can never become
//! the principal, never satisfy `require_id`, and never satisfy `known_agents`
//! — an allowlist satisfied by self-declaration is not a control.
//!
//! There is deliberately no unsigned-token rung. A base64 decode of a JWT
//! payload with no signature check is not proof of anything; it is the caller's
//! own assertion in a format that looks authoritative, which is worse than an
//! unadorned header because it reads as verified.
//!
//! # Configuration
//!
//! ```yaml
//! security:
//!   agent_identity:
//!     enabled: false       # opt-in; enforcement is a no-op when false
//!     require_id: false    # when true, requests that prove no agent are rejected
//!     known_agents: []     # optional allowlist of accepted PROVEN principals
//!     allow_unverified_agent_identity: false  # legacy: a label may satisfy the above
//!     principal_labels: []                    # opt-in: extra labels a principal may declare
//! ```
//!
//! `known_agents` is a **proven-principal** allowlist: when non-empty, a proven
//! principal outside the list is rejected, independently of `require_id`, which
//! governs only the no-proof case. An anonymous caller is unaffected by a
//! non-empty `known_agents` — that has never been a refusal and is not one now.
